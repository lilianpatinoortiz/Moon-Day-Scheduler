# Moon-Day-Scheduler

### ~ Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Hello - and welcome to the moon, we are happy to know you made it safe in our rocket JP2314!
Please plan your day using this calendar. All your actions will be monitored from earth.
Make sure you schedule exercising and recording your findings in the moon. Good luck!

I really enjoyed doing this challenge. I was able to learn how dayjs works and how to use also the timers here to display the notifications when an event is saved or updated. From the javascript file we are basically able to modify any DOM element and with the use of JQUERY we are also able to access elements, moodify them and manipulate them as needed.

## Usage

After cloning and running the project you will be able to add events to your moon calendar!
The hour will be colored different depending on the time. Red is the current hour in Earth, green is future hour in Earth and gray is a past hour in Earth. You can add and modify the events for the day. The events will persist even if you refresh the page. Use it wisely and please make sure you register any information we can use to help you for our mission! Good luck

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
