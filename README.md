# Moon-Day-Scheduler

### ~ Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler üåù

## Description

Hello - and welcome to the moon, we are happy to know you made it safe in our rocket JP2314!
Please plan your day using this calendar. All your actions will be monitored from earth.
Make sure you schedule exercising and recording your findings in the moon. Good luck!

I really enjoyed doing this challenge. I was able to learn how dayjs works and how to use also the timers here to display the notifications when an event is saved or updated. From the javascript file we are basically able to modify any DOM element and with the use of JQUERY we are also able to access elements, moodify them and manipulate them as needed.
